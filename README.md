Big data is found in:

a) Social Netwoks
b) Data Analytics
    Most of the  machine learning will be done here. For example if a company needs to find out the interest of the customer with his most recent purchases and offer him with the best products.
c) Storage - NoSql
     NoSql is not very good at handling the Non-Orbitrary queries. 
     Documents, Graphs, Key-Value, colomar store. 
     Twitter uses UTF8 for saving their tweets. 
     It is very difficult to collect the data and store as the data is non-uniform and it may have differnet characters and     Images. 

d) Data LifeCycle. (steps)
     ->Colletion of the generating data.(Data is collected up on knowing what has to be collected called as question apart of it one more content is Curation another aspect of Curation is Triag(prioritization of the situation)and in the end persistance of the data)
     ->Clean up 
     ->Storage. 
     ->Processing/Analysis 
     ->query/Visualization/Act.(Gives the new question with the received answer)
     
     Http request response Cycle.
